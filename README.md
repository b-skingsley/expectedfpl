From the home page, select the 'Take a Tour' button.

![Team View](https://github.com/b-skingsley/expectedfpl/blob/master/app/assets/images/read_me/team_view_highlighted.jpg?raw=true)
* Say hello to your team dashboard. 
    * Javascript player highlighting provides you with valid switches, based on player position    and team formation.
    * Expand player rows in your team sideboard to view injuries and 'XGoals'.
    * Get even more in-depth player information with the 'more-info' player modal.

![XGoals](https://github.com/b-skingsley/expectedfpl/blob/master/app/assets/images/read_me/xgoals_feature.jpg?raw=true)
** XFPL's crowning feature ** 
* We plug live and historical Premier League data from APIs into a Poisson formula, for our 'expected' event!
    * Expected goals for forwards and midfielders.
    * Clean sheets chances for defenders and keepers.

![Transfer Out](https://github.com/b-skingsley/expectedfpl/blob/master/app/assets/images/read_me/transfer_out.jpg?raw=true)
Clicking the 'transfer out' icon to the top right of a player shirt will take you to the transfers page. Arguably the most useful feature is the **'filter by budget'** bar, where you can disregard players that would take you over your available budget.

![Make a Transfer](https://github.com/b-skingsley/expectedfpl/blob/master/app/assets/images/read_me/transfers.jpg?raw=true)
Javascript expandable rows provide a seamless UX.
* Complete transfer with the plus icon (you will be asked for confirmation).
* Visit the dedicated player page using the 'more info' button.

![Player View](https://github.com/b-skingsley/expectedfpl/blob/master/app/assets/images/read_me/player_directory.jpg?raw=true)
* See the difficulty of the player's next 5 fixtures, again with our clever algorithm!
* JS Typed player news reel.
